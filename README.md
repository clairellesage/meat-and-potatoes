# meat-and-potatoes

Meat and Potatoes is a Chrome extension that skips to the ingredients section on recipe websites. 

There are two main goals for this project:

-to pick out a node or a node's innerHTML that says 'ingredients'
-scroll to that content when the extension is clicked

# next steps
-autoscroll on page load (maybe for a defined list of recipe sites)
-select the ingredients and directions and save to a file.
