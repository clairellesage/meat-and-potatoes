# meat-and-potatoes

Meat and Potatoes is a Chrome extension that skips to the ingredients section on recipe websites. 

There are two main goals for this project:

-to pick out the header that says 'ingredients'
-auto scroll to that content

-then, select the ingredients and directions and save to a file.
